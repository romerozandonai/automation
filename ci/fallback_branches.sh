###### STEPS ######

# git fetch origin -> get all the updates from all the branches
# git checkout COMPARE_BRANCH -> enter the branch who is gonna use on the merge
# git reset --hard origin/COMPARE_BRANCH -> put the COMPARE_BRANCH to the state that is on the origin repository
# git checkout TARGET_BRANCH -> enter the branch who is gonna receive the merge
# git reset --hard origin/TARGET_BRANCH -> put the TARGET_BRANCH to the state that is on the origin repository
# git merge COMPARE_BRANCH --no-ff -> execute the merge with no fast forward method
